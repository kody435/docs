= Testing

This guide will teach you the basics of testing views in Hilla. We will use the https://vitest.dev/[Vitest] library for testing and set up a configuration that runs tests in an actual browser to produce accurate results. We will also use the https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/[React Testing Library] to render and interact with React components during tests.

== Setting Up the Test Environment

Before we start testing, make sure your Hilla project is initialized, and the default Vite config exists. You can achieve this by starting the application once by running the default Maven goal:

[source,shell]
----
mvn
----

Now, install the necessary testing libraries:

[source,shell]
----
npm install -D vitest @vitest/browser webdriverio pretty-format @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event
----

Next, create a test configuration file named [filename]`vitest.config.ts` in the project root with the following content:

[source,typescript]
----
import type { UserConfigFn } from 'vite';
import { overrideVaadinConfig } from './vite.generated';

const customConfig: UserConfigFn = (env) => ({
  plugins: [],
  test: {
    include: ['./tests/**/*.{test,spec}.ts?(x)'],
    globals: true,
    browser: {
      enabled: true,
      name: 'chrome',
    }
  },
});

export default overrideVaadinConfig(customConfig);
----

Finally, add an NPM script to [filename]`package.json` to run the tests and open the Vitest UI:
[source,json]
----
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest"
}

----

You can now run the tests by executing:

[source,shell]
----
npm test
----

For now, this command will fail because haven't written any tests yet. We'll do that in the next section.

== Writing Tests

In this guide, we'll use a simple Todo view as an example to demonstrate how to test views in Hilla. To get started, let's create a basic view in [filename]`frontend/views/TodoView.tsx`:

[source,tsx]
----
export function TodoView() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>My Todos</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
----

Now, create a basic test for this view in a file named [filename]`frontend/tests/TodoView.test.tsx`:

[source,tsx]
----
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { TodoView } from "Frontend/views/TodoView";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";

describe("TodoView", () => {
  it("should render", () => {
    render(<TodoView />);
    expect(screen.getByText("My Todos")).to.exist;
  });
});
----

The test file contains a single test that renders the view and verifies that the "My Todos" text is present in the DOM.

Start the test runner again by running:

[source,shell]
----
npm test
----

This will open a browser window and display the Vitest UI for running and monitoring tests. It should run the newly added test and report that it passed.

== Testing User Interaction

Now, let's explore how to add a feature to the view and test it with user interactions. We'll add an input field and a button to add new todos, along with a list to render them. Here's the updated `TodoView` component:

[source,tsx]
----
import { Button } from "@hilla/react-components/Button.js";
import {
  TextField,
  TextFieldValueChangedEvent,
} from "@hilla/react-components/TextField.js";
import { useState } from "react";

export function TodoView() {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState("");
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Array<string>>([]);

  return (
    <div className="p-m">
      <h2>My Todos</h2>
      <div className="flex gap-s items-baseline">
        <TextField
          label="New todo"
          value={newTodo}
          onValueChanged={(e: TextFieldValueChangedEvent) =>
            setNewTodo(e.detail.value)
          }
        />
        <Button
          onClick={() => {
            setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
            setNewTodo("");
          }}
        >
          Add todo
        </Button>
      </div>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, idx) => (
          <li key={idx}>{todo}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
----

Next, we'll add a test that interacts with the view. For testing interactions, we'll import `userEvent` from `@testing-library/user-event`:

[source,tsx]
----
import { userEvent } from "@testing-library/user-event";

describe("TodoView", () => {
  ...

  it("should add a todo", async () => {
    render(<TodoView />);

    // Change the value of the text field
    const textField = screen.getByLabelText("New todo");
    await userEvent.click(textField);
    await userEvent.type(textField, "Read testing guide");

    // Click the add todo button
    const button = screen.getByText("Add todo");
    await userEvent.click(button);

    // Rerender and check that the todo is shown
    expect(screen.getByText("Read testing guide")).to.exist;
  });
});
----

The new test first finds the text field and changes its value using `userEvent.type`. Next, it finds the button and clicks it using `userEvent.click`. Finally, it verifies that the new todo is rendered in the list. Save the test, and Vitest will run it in the browser, verifying that the interaction works as expected.

== Testing Backend Calls

Views often need to interact with backend services, and we want to test this interaction as well. In this section, we'll create a backend service to store todos and then verify that it's called correctly from the view. First, create a dummy service called [filename]`TodoService.java` next to [filename]`Application.java`:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.application;

import com.vaadin.flow.server.auth.AnonymousAllowed;
import dev.hilla.BrowserCallable;

@BrowserCallable
@AnonymousAllowed
public class TodoService {
    public void addTodo(String todo) {
        System.out.println("addTodo: " + todo);
    }
}
----

The service has a single method `addTodo` that just prints the given todo to the console.

Then, from the CLI, run the following command to generate the TypeScript client for the service:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean compile hilla:generate
----

Now, update the click handler of the button in `TodoView` to call the service:

[source,tsx]
----
/* Add new import for generated service client */
import { TodoService } from "Frontend/generated/endpoints";

...

<Button
  onClick={() => {
    TodoService.addTodo(newTodo);
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
    setNewTodo("");
  }}
>
  Add todo
</Button>
----

Next, we'll add a test to verify that the service is called correctly. We'll also set up a test environment that stubs the service to prevent actual backend calls and allows us to spy on calls:

[source,tsx]
----
/* Update imports from vitest */
import { afterEach, beforeEach, describe, expect, it, type SpyInstance, vi } from "vitest";

/* Add new import for generated service client */
import { TodoService } from "Frontend/generated/endpoints";

describe("TodoView", () => {
  /* Add test setup and teardown */
  let addTodoSpy: SpyInstance;

  beforeEach(() => {
    addTodoSpy = vi.spyOn(TodoService, "addTodo");
    addTodoSpy.mockReturnValue(Promise.resolve());
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    addTodoSpy.mockRestore();
  });

  ...

  it("should call service when adding todo", async () => {
    render(<TodoView />);

    const textField = screen.getByLabelText("New todo");
    await userEvent.click(textField);
    await userEvent.type(textField, "Read testing guide");

    const button = screen.getByText("Add todo");
    await userEvent.click(button);

    expect(addTodoSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Read testing guide");
  });
});

----

In the `beforeEach` hook, we first create a spy for the `addTodo` method of the service. Then, we stub the spy to return a resolved promise to prevent the actual backend call. Finally, we restore the original method in the `afterEach` hook to prevent the stub from leaking to other tests.

The actual test does the same user interaction as before, but this time, we verify that the service is called with the correct argument. Save the test, and Vitest will run it in the browser, verifying that the service is called correctly.
